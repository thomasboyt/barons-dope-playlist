my internet friend barons made a cool playlist but he uploaded it as a winamp html file which who the hell does that in 2016

i wanted to listen to it in spotify and here we are

so i wrote and ran `bin/parse.js` to parse the songs out from the file into json. then i ran `bin/spotify.js` which searches every song then uploads them as a playlist.

I also had to manually update playlist.json a whole bunch because Barons's shit was super mistagged :(
